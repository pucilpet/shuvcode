## Feature Highlights

### Desktop PWA Mobile Support

The desktop web app now fully supports mobile devices as a Progressive Web App (PWA):

- **Dynamic island handling**: Proper background color fills the notch/dynamic island area on newer iPhones
- **Mobile menu**: Full-screen navigation overlay accessible via hamburger button
- **Review overlay**: Access session changes and file viewer on mobile via the "Review" button in the header
- **Split/inline diff toggle**: Switch between side-by-side and inline diff views in the review panel
- **Responsive layout**: Timeline rail hidden on mobile, session pane takes full width

Install as PWA on iOS: Open in Safari → Share → Add to Home Screen

---

### IDE Integration (Cursor/VSCode)

Connect to Cursor, VSCode, or other supported IDEs for enhanced workflow:

- **Live text selection** from your editor is displayed in the TUI footer
- **Selection context** is automatically included in prompts (invisible to you, but sent to the model)
- **IDE status** shown on the home screen footer
- **Diff view** support for file edits (open diffs directly in your IDE)

Configure in `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "ide": {
    "lockfile_dir": "~/.cursor/opencode/",
    "auth_header_name": "x-opencode-auth",
  },
}
```

Supported IDEs: Cursor, VSCode, VSCode Insiders, VSCodium, Windsurf

---

### Add Existing Project Dialog

The desktop "Create project" button now opens an improved "Add Project" dialog with two tabs:

- **Add Existing**: Browse and search folders from your home directory with fuzzy search, see git repo indicators, and add existing projects with one click
- **Create New**: Original path input for creating new project directories

The folder browser scans up to 2 levels deep from `$HOME`, prioritizes git repositories, and shows which folders are already added as projects.

---

### Desktop Image Preview

The desktop file viewer now displays actual image previews for PNG, JPG, GIF, and WEBP files instead of showing raw base64 text. Images are centered and scaled to fit within the viewport with scrolling support for large images. SVG files are excluded from image preview and render as syntax-highlighted XML code.

---

### TUI Spinner Styles

Choose from 60+ animated spinner styles for tool execution indicators. Access via the command palette with `Change spinner style`. Your selection is persisted across sessions.

Available styles include braille patterns, block animations, geometric shapes, and creative concepts like moon phases, clock sweeps, and bouncing balls.

You can also adjust the animation speed via `Change spinner speed` in the command palette. Options range from 20ms (fastest) to 500ms (slowest), with 60ms as the default.

---

### TUI Layout Density

The TUI automatically adapts its vertical spacing for small terminals (< 28 rows). Configure via `tui.density`:

- `auto` (default): Switches to compact mode on small terminals
- `comfortable`: Standard spacing with footer and hints
- `compact`: Reduced padding, hides footer and secondary hints

Toggle density from the command palette or set in config:

```jsonc
{
  "tui": {
    "density": "auto",
  },
}
```

---

### Granular File Permissions

Restrict which files an agent can edit using glob patterns:

```jsonc
{
  "agent": {
    "plan": {
      "permission": {
        "edit": {
          "**/*.md": "allow",
          "CONTEXT/**": "allow",
          "*": "deny",
        },
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Precedence rules: exact match > more path segments > longer pattern > `*` fallback

---

### AskQuestion Tool (Experimental)

Enable the AI to pause and ask structured questions via a wizard UI. Available in both TUI and web app.

Enable in `opencode.json`:

```jsonc
{
  "experimental": {
    "askquestion_tool": true,
  },
}
```

Features:
- Wizard-style multi-question dialogs with single/multi-select options
- Custom text input for freeform responses
- Keyboard navigation (1-8 quick select, Tab between questions, Enter to confirm)
- Works across TUI and web app with session resume support

---

### Agents

OpenCode includes two built-in agents you can switch between,
you can switch between these using the `Tab` key.

- **build** - Default, full access agent for development work
- **plan** - Read-only agent for analysis and code exploration
  - Denies file edits by default
  - Asks permission before running bash commands
  - Ideal for exploring unfamiliar codebases or planning changes

Also, included is a **general** subagent for complex searches and multi-step tasks.
This is used internally and can be invoked using `@general` in messages.

Learn more about [agents](https://opencode.ai/docs/agents).

### Sessions Sidebar

A NERDTree-style sidebar for managing sessions. Toggle with `ctrl+n`.

| Key            | Action                       |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `j/k` or `↑/↓` | Move cursor                  |
| `Enter` or `o` | Open session / Toggle expand |
| `O`            | Expand all children          |
| `x`            | Collapse parent              |
| `X`            | Collapse all                 |
| `p`            | Go to parent                 |
| `g/G`          | Jump to top/bottom           |
| `n`            | New session                  |
| `r`            | Rename session               |
| `d`            | Delete session               |
| `?`            | Show help                    |
| `q` or `Esc`   | Close sidebar                |

### Building on OpenCode

If you are working on a project that's related to OpenCode and is using "opencode" as a part of its name; for example, "opencode-dashboard" or "opencode-mobile", please add a note to your README to clarify that it is not built by the OpenCode team and is not affiliated with us in any way.

### FAQ

#### How is this different than Claude Code?

It's very similar to Claude Code in terms of capability. Here are the key differences:

- 100% open source
- Not coupled to any provider. Although we recommend the models we provide through [OpenCode Zen](https://opencode.ai/zen); OpenCode can be used with Claude, OpenAI, Google or even local models. As models evolve the gaps between them will close and pricing will drop so being provider-agnostic is important.
- Out of the box LSP support
- A focus on TUI. OpenCode is built by neovim users and the creators of [terminal.shop](https://terminal.shop); we are going to push the limits of what's possible in the terminal.
- A client/server architecture. This for example can allow OpenCode to run on your computer, while you can drive it remotely from a mobile app. Meaning that the TUI frontend is just one of the possible clients.

#### What's the other repo?

The other confusingly named repo has no relation to this one. You can [read the story behind it here](https://x.com/thdxr/status/1933561254481666466).
